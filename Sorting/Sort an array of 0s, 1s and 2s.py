"""
Given an array A of size N containing 0s, 1s, and 2s; you need to sort the array in ascending order.

Input:
The first line contains an integer 'T' denoting the total number of test cases. Then T testcases follow.
Each testcases contains two lines of input. The first line denotes the size of the array N. The second lines
contains the elements of the array A separated by spaces.

Output:
For each testcase, print the sorted array.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 500
1 <= N <= 106
0 <= Ai <= 2

Example:
Input :
2
5
0 2 1 2 0
3
0 1 0

Output:
0 0 1 2 2
0 0 1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: After segregating the 0s, 1s and 2s, we have 0 0 1 2 2 which shown in the output.
