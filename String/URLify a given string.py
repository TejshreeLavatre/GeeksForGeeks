""""
Write a method to replace all the spaces in a string S with ‘%20’. You may assume that the string has sufficient space
(or allocated memory) at the end to hold the additional characters,

Note: The leading and trailing spaces should be trimmed off and not replaced by %20.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The T test cases follow. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a string S. The next line contains an integer K that denotes the length of the S with whitespace included.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the string with spaces replaced by "%20".

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= |S|+ K <= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
Mr John Smith
13
Mr Benedict Cumberbatch
25

Output:
"Mr%20John%20Smith"
"Mr%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch

Explanation:
Here in the second case 25 means that there are 25 characters taken into input. While the length of the string is 23 , it means that there are 2 extra spaces at the end which needs to be removed and is contained in input. So the output should be those 23 characters with 2 extra spaces removed and spaces between word replaced with %20.

for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(input().replace(' ', '%20'))
    input()                                  #for length of S
